Homopolymer truncation (HPT) - Converts FASTA/FASTQ files to truncate all
homopolymers to a single base. This has the effect of removing homopolymer
indels from downstream analysis. Based upon the error models of some high-
throughput sequencing technologies, this can be highly benefitial when
looking for sequence variations. It is somewhat similar to aligning sequences
in flow-space, but has the slight difference in that the length of the
homopolymer isn't considered.

HPT analysis may be useful for 454, PacBio, Ion Torrent datasets

Caution: If HPT converted sequences are used for variant detection, any
variation that would cause an expansion of a homopolymer will be missed.

    Example:
    GAGG -> GAAG (G->A) would both be converted to GAG with HPT and the
    variant would be missed.
